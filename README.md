# Camouflage Object Detection Software

## Overview

This software is designed for **camouflage object detection**, focusing on detecting and identifying camouflaged objects in images. It leverages deep learning models to analyze images and identify hidden or semi-hidden targets that blend into the background. This software includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction and testing.

The main feature of the software is the ability to detect camouflaged objects, whether they are partially or fully hidden, by processing images with pre-trained models and advanced image analysis techniques.

## Features

- **Camouflage Detection**: Detect camouflaged objects in images using advanced deep learning models.
- **Image Upload & Display**: Upload and display input images and corresponding detection results.
- **GUI Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for running detection and visualizing results.
- **Model Integration**: Use pre-trained models for detecting camouflaged objects.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Process images in real-time for efficient detection.
- **Output Results**: Visualize the detection results with bounding boxes around identified objects.

## Installation

### Requirements

Before running the software, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `opencv` for image processing
- `torch` and `torchvision` for deep learning model inference
- `PyQt5` for GUI functionality

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
